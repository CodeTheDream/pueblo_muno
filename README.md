# Menu del Pueblo

Massive survey taking and simple data analysis.

### What it does

This app helps [El Pueblo](http://www.elpueblo.org/) survey their members for their opinions about future actions. It also displays some the results simply and cleanly.

### Who it's for

Since this app is tailor made for El Pueblo and their people, a [dummy app](http://dummymenu.herokuapp.com/) has also been made to provide a live example of the code for perusers.

### How to use it

*See full documentation of each option below*

* `/`: is a simple navigation page
* `/start`: begins the survey. Only affiliation with El Pueblo is required to continue
